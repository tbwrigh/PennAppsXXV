## Built for the 2024 PennApps XXV Hackathon at The University of Pennsylvania
### By: Tyler Wright & Megan Kulshekar


### Overview
Sometimes finding a time to meet with friends can be tricky! Let's Meet is a web app that allows users to schedule meetings and get togethers effortlessly. With just a few clicks, users can manage, share, and create meetings right from their accounts.

### Technology
The frontend is implemented using React with the Ant Design Library for styling components. The user interface is built using Typescript, HTML, and CSS. For the backend, Terraform, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB were used to store and retrieve data efficiently as well as deploy to the cloud. AWS Amplify was also used to host the app and provide secure user authentication.

### Running the Project
Clone the repository and run npm install to install the necessary libraries. Then run $env:VITE_API_URL="{AWS API}"; npm run dev.
